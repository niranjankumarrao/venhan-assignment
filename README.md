# VENHAN React Flow - Freshers' Starter Project

This is a simple React app that renders a dynamic diagram using React Flow.
The app is written in a straightforward style to look like code from a fresher candidate.

## Features
- Load nodes and edges from `src/metadata.json`
- Add / edit / delete nodes and edges via sidebar forms
- Connect nodes by dragging in the flow area
- State saved to localStorage so diagram persists on refresh

## Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains components and app code
- `src/metadata.json` is the sample metadata
- `public/index.html` is the static HTML

## Notes
- The code is simple and readable.
- For production or larger projects, consider adding better error handling and tests.
